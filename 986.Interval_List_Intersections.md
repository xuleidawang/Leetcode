Given two lists of closed intervals, each list of intervals is pairwise disjoint and in sorted order.  

Return the intersection of these two interval lists.  

(Formally, a closed interval [a, b] (with a <= b) denotes the set of real numbers x with a <= x <= b.  The intersection of two closed intervals is a set of real numbers that is either empty, or can be represented as a closed interval.  For example, the intersection of [1, 3] and [2, 4] is [2, 3].)

```
Input: A = [[0,2],[5,10],[13,23],[24,25]], B = [[1,5],[8,12],[15,24],[25,26]]
Output: [[1,2],[5,5],[8,10],[15,23],[24,24],[25,25]]
Reminder: The inputs and the desired output are lists of Interval objects, and not arrays or lists.

        vector< vector <int> > res;
        int i=0, j=0;
        
        while(i<A.size() && j<B.size()){
            vector<int> cur1 = A[i];
            vector<int> cur2 = B[j];
            
            int start = max(cur1[0], cur2[0]);
            int end = min(cur1[1], cur2[1]);
            if(start<=end){
                res.push_back(vector<int>{start, end});
            }
            if(cur1[1] <= cur2[1]){
                i++;
            }
            else j++;
        }
        return res;
    }
