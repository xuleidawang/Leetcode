Given a **complete** binary tree, count the number of nodes.  
In a complete binary tree every level, except possibly the last, is completed filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and $2^h$ nodes inclusive at the last level h.  

**Example:**  
```
Input: 
    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \  /
4  5 6

Output: 6
```

```
class Solution {
public:
    int countNodes(TreeNode* root) {
        if(!root)  return 0;
        int hl=0, hr=0;
        
        //if the #left nodes == #right nodes. current subtree is complete
        TreeNode *l=root, *r=root;
        while(l) { hl++; l=l->left; }
        while(r) { hr++; r=r->right; }
        
        if(hl==hr) return pow(2, hl)-1;
        return 1+countNodes(root->left)+countNodes(root->right);
    }
};
```
