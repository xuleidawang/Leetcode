Given a list of airline tickets represented by pairs of departure and arrival airports [from, to], reconstruct the itinerary in order. All of the tickets belong to a man who departs from JFK. Thus, the itinerary must begin with JFK.

Note:

If there are multiple valid itineraries, you should return the itinerary that has the smallest lexical order when read as a single string. For example, the itinerary ["JFK", "LGA"] has a smaller lexical order than ["JFK", "LGB"].
All airports are represented by three capital letters (IATA code).
You may assume all tickets form at least one valid itinerary.
Example 1:

Input: [["MUC", "LHR"], ["JFK", "MUC"], ["SFO", "SJC"], ["LHR", "SFO"]]
Output: ["JFK", "MUC", "LHR", "SFO", "SJC"]

Example 2:

Input: [["JFK","SFO"],["JFK","ATL"],["SFO","ATL"],["ATL","JFK"],["ATL","SFO"]]
Output: ["JFK","ATL","JFK","SFO","ATL","SFO"]
Explanation: Another possible reconstruction is
["JFK","SFO","ATL","JFK","ATL","SFO"].
But it is larger in lexical order.
```         
vector<string> findItinerary(vector<vector<string>>& tickets) {
	//graph: start --> destinationes
	unordered_map<string, multiset<string> > targets;
    //path result
    vector<string> res;
    //build the graph as adjacent list
    //multiset sort the destination in lexical order defaultly
    for(auto t:tickets){
    targets[t[0]].insert(t[1]);
    }             
    //run dfs with stack
    stack<string> dfs;
    dfs.push("JFK");
    while(!dfs.empty()){
    	string cur = dfs.top();
    	if(targets[cur].size()!=0){
    		auto next =targets[cur].begin();
            dfs.push(*next);
            targets[cur].erase(next);
        }else{
        	res.push_back(cur);
            dfs.pop();
        }
    }
    reverse(res.begin(), res.end());
    return vector<string> (res.begin(), res.end());
}
```
