A rectangle is represented as a list [x1, y1, x2, y2], where (x1, y1) are the coordinates of its bottom-left corner, and (x2, y2) are the coordinates of its top-right corner.

Two rectangles overlap if the area of their intersection is positive.  To be clear, two rectangles that only touch at the corner or edges do not overlap.

Given two (axis-aligned) rectangles, return whether they overlap.  

**Example:**  
```
Input: rec1 = [0,0,2,2], rec2 = [1,1,3,3]
Output: true
```
```
Consider a 1D overlap(Interval problem).
     For an overlap to occur necessary condition is
     
             x3,y2          x4,y2
               |--------------|
     |--------------|
     x1,y1         x2,y1
              
     x1 < x3 < x2  && x3 < x2 < x4 
     
     Or simplified - x1 < x4 && x3 < x2
     For 2D case use 1D conditions for both X and Y axes
     
     Case-1: Rec2 intersects with Rec1 on top right corner
